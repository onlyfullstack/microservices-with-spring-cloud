Lets take a quick look into the terminologies on a higher level :
**Feign**  – declarative REST client
**Ribbon**  – client side load balancer
**Eureka** – service registration and discovery
**Zuul Gateway** –  gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more
**Sleuth –** distributed tracing via logs
**Zipkin –** distributed tracing system with request visualization.

Below are the post which will go through the step by step implementation of microsevices with spring cloud.
